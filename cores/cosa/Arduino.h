 *
 *   The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
 *   Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
 *   Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
 *   The moment one looked in his face!
 *
 *   He had bought a large map representing the sea,
 *   Without the least vestige of land:
 *   And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
 *   A map they could all understand.
 *
 *   "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
 *   Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"
 *   So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
 *   "They are merely conventional signs!
 *
 *   "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
 *   But we've got our brave Captain to thank:
 *   (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best--
 *   A perfect and absolute blank!"

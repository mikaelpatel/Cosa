/**
 * Debounded Button; Sampled input pin (with internal pullup
 * resistor). Uses a periodic function with timout of 64 ms for
 * sampling and on change calls an event action. Subclass Button and
 * implement the virtual on_change() method. Use the subclass for any
 * state needed for the action function. Connect button/switch from
 * pin to ground. Internal pull-up resistor is activated.

 * @section Limitations
 * Button toggle faster than sample period may be missed. This is the

 * @section See Also
 * The Button event handler requires the usage of an event dispatch or
 * implementing the virtual member function Job::on_expired() to call
 * run() and reschedule().

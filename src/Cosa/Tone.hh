/**
 * Cosa tone/toneAC library with the advantage of nearly twice the volume,
 * higher frequencies (even if running at a lower clock speed), higher
 * quality (less clicking), nearly 1.5k smaller compiled code and less
 * stress on the speaker. Disadvantages are that it must use certain
 * pins and it uses two pins instead of one. But, if you're flexible
 * with your pin choices, this is a great upgrade. It also uses timer
 * 1 instead of timer 2, which may free up a conflict you have with
 * the tone library. It exclusively uses port registers for the
 * fastest and smallest code possible.
 *
 * @section Circuit
 * Connection is very similar to a piezo or standard speaker. Except,
 * instead of connecting one speaker wire to ground you connect both
 * speaker wires to Arduino pins. The pins you connect to are
 * specific, as the class lets the ATmega microcontroller do all the
 * pin timing and switching. This is important due to the high
 * switching speed possible and to make sure the pins are alyways
 * perfectly out of phase with each other (push/pull). See the below
 * section for which pins to use for different Arduino boards. Just as
 * usual when connecting a speaker, make sure you add an inline 100
 * ohm resistor between one of the pins and the speaker wire.
 *
 * Pins  9 & 10 - ATmega328, ATmega128, ATmega640, Uno, Leonardo, etc.
 * Pins 11 & 12 - ATmega2560/2561, ATmega1280/1281, Mega
 * Pins 12 & 13 - ATmega1284P, ATmega644, Mighty
 * Pins 14 & 15 - ATmega32U4, Teensy 2.0

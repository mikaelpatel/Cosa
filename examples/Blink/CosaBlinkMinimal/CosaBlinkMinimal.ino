 * @section Description
 * Cosa LED blink demonstration. The classical LED blink program
 * written in Cosa using the Arduino built-in LED and minimal number of
 * lines of code. Uses the OutputPin static member function toggle to
 * turn on and off the built-in LED. And the default delay function
 * which is a busy-wait loop.
 * The pin must be set up as an Output pin since the default is Input.
 *
 * @section Circuit
 * Uses built-in LED (D13/Arduino).
 *
 * This file is part of the Arduino Che Cosa project.

 * @section Description
 * A simple model with Clock, Button and LED. The connectors are
 * probed. The LED will blink when the Button is on otherwise the LED
 * is turned off. The probes will trace changes to the connector
 * value. The Clock and the Button are timed capsules. The clock has a
 * period of 1024 ms and the Button 64 ms. The Button will debounce the
 * digital input pin. The LED has control dependency to the Clock tick
 * and a data dependency to the Button signal.

Demonstration of Cosa TWI driver for the DS1307, 64 X 8, Serial I2C Real-Time Clock. See Screenshot.

Circuit

The Arduino analog pins 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL) are used for I2C/TWI connection. Pullup resistors are not needed in this example as the internal pullup resistors are enabled.

Note 

The bench picture also contains wiring of an NRF24L01P. Please ignore this for this example.
